<h1>If one of my names on my academic certificates is different than that on the passport only in one letter precisely Fathi instead of Fathy, will it be a problem when applying for a visa in Germany (work or higher education)?</h1>

If it is your surname, your last name, then it should match your passport.

Someone made a mistake and that someone has to correct it.

Call the embassy and ask them what to do … maybe they know your country and the most errors that are frequently made there by some organisations or offices.

My name is Meert … I don’t have to show up any document with the name Meers on it … it wouldn’t be mine.

But when you rather risk to see your application refused and as such you lost your money … go ahead, I think the Germans will love to see you pay again. And maybe even the translation of your degree and the legalisation of it … all costs to be paid again.

Again : pick up the phone and call them or send them an email with the documents scanned in.

Highly likely. Even if they accept that one is simply an error, why would they allow you to submit incorrect documents?

I would try to get the certificates amended if I were you.
