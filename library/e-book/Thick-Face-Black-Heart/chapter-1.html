         <a id="page7"></a><span class="dropcap"><strong class="calibre5">T</strong></span>hick Face, Black Heart describes the secret law of nature that governs successful behavior in every aspect of life. The American
         pioneers had it. Asian businessmen use it. From ancient times to the present, all successful people utilize the secret. Thick
         Face, Black Heart is the wisdom of the soul, and it knows no division of nationality, race, or religion. The implementation
         of this law benefits people in their business practices as well as in their personal lives. Being true to the law of nature
         in our daily encounters fulfills the highest potential within and around us, thus leading us to the proper unfolding of our
         destiny. Through the utilization of the power of Thick Face, Black Heart, each one of us will discover the destiny to which
         we must be true.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">
         <a id="page8"></a>Americans are constantly bombarded through the media with images of success and happiness. Success is often judged by our
         possessions: the make of car we drive, the designer watch we sport, or the latest fashions we have wrapped around our bodies.
         Yet, a successful life is one that is lived through understanding and pursuing one’s own path, not chasing after the dreams
         or fulfilling the expectations of others.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">Many people are so completely obsessed with the pursuit of false euphoria that they attempt to deny the existence of life’s
         difficulties. A positive attitude is important, but it is only part of the story. Understanding how to surmount pain, doubt,
         and failure is a vital component in winning the game of life. So often we are so concerned with what makes us feel good that
         we forget what makes us great.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">Character is not made out of sunshine and roses. Like steel, it is forged in fire, between the hammer and the anvil. By getting
         in touch with the power of Thick Face, Black Heart, you will realize a new consciousness. One of the results of reading this
         book will be the shattering of your traditional concepts of ruthlessness. Thick Face, Black Heart is and is not about ruthlessness.
         You will learn that by adapting and adopting a form of nondestructive ruthlessness, you will gain the freedom necessary to
         achieve effective execution of your life’s tasks.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">Thick Face, Black Heart is not about mastering a specific skill, nor is it something I can give to you. The power of Thick
         Face, Black Heart is already within you. It is your inner strength and the natural state of your true self, where perfect
         joy, clarity, courage, and compassion are an inseparable part of you.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">By tapping into this power, to whatever degree you can, you cannot fail to benefit. The power of Thick Face, Black Heart will
         guide you to be effective in your actions and lead 
         <a id="page9"></a>you to your desired results. Most of all, by getting in touch with this power within you, you will gain unshakable clarity
         and focus to help you discover and achieve your intended destiny.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre8">THE INWARD STATE</h1>
      <p class="toc-front">Thick Face, Black Heart is not a doctrine in itself. Rather, it concerns an element that is common to many doctrines. On its
         practical, less philosophical level, Thick Face, Black Heart is simply about action and its effectiveness.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">To take an example from modern America: Dozens of books are published each year that attempt to teach you how to make yourself
         a more effective executive, a better salesperson, and generally a happier, more dynamic individual. In these books, the author
         prescribes a course of action that will lead to the desired result. Typically, it is a plan that has worked for the author
         and for some of his students. But it doesn’t necessarily work well for many readers, even though they carefully follow the
         author’s instructions. For example, two people can read the same book on lion-taming. They can enter the lion’s cage dressed
         identically. They can use identical gestures and words to command the lion. But the results will not be the same. One of them
         will get the lion to jump through the hoop, and the other will end up as a gruesome mess on the floor of the lion’s cage.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">These authors do not seem to be aware that there is an inward state that must be achieved in order for words and actions to
         be effective. The experts who write these books are good at what they do because they have had the luck to achieve that state
         intuitively or unconsciously. They do not seem to comprehend the problems of those who have not been so fortunate.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">
         <a id="page10"></a>Thick Face, Black Heart is a theory of great practical use. It can be applied to any endeavor, and utilized for either good
         or evil purposes. The first superficial exposure to Thick Face, Black Heart is often shocking and repellent because it can
         serve the criminal as easily as the saint. It seems to be a selfish, ruthless, and completely amoral concept. However, I contend
         that these do not necessarily have to be destructive attributes.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">As the name implies, there are two elements to this inward state: the Thick Face and the Black Heart.</p>
      <h2 class="calibre8">Thick Face—The Shield</h2>
      <p class="toc-front">Consider the Asian concept of face. It refers to how other people think about you and treat you. Most Asians are tremendously
         concerned that others think well of them and especially that others display respect for their personal dignity. Juxtapose
         this idea with the Western notion that having a thick skin and being insensitive to criticism and the negative opinions of
         others is best. Fused together, these two ideas approximate the concept of Thick Face: a shield to protect our self-esteem
         from the bad opinions of others. A person adept at Thick Face creates his own positive self-image despite the criticism of
         others.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">In attempting any goal, there is always room for doubt about our ability to achieve, our motives for achieving, or our worthiness
         to receive the benefits of achievement. Often we feel a need to first improve ourselves, believing that only after we have
         become more worthy will we be able to achieve the fulfillment of our dreams.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">The thick-faced person has the ability to put self-doubt aside. He refuses to accept the limitations that others have tried
         to impose on him and, more importantly, he does not accept 
         <a id="page11"></a>any of the limitations that we commonly impose on ourselves. He does not question his ability or worthiness. In his own eyes,
         he is perfect.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">The world has a tendency to accept our own judgment of ourselves. By his absolute self-confidence, the thick-faced person
         instills confidence in others. They see him as successful and allow him the latitude to succeed.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">Former president Ronald Reagan represents a good example of a Thick Face. He had very limited skills as an administrator.
         His aides’ most important job was to prevent him from making off-the-cuff remarks about complex issues. Whenever he did, he
         invariably betrayed an appalling ignorance of the subject. But Mr. Reagan had such an unshakable image of himself as a great
         statesman that he acted decisively even when totally ignorant of the issues involved. His simple answers made America feel
         confident. After years of social turmoil at home and humiliation abroad, Americans began to feel good again, to feel that
         things were under control once more. The American people shared Ronald Reagan’s opinion of himself, and he finished his term
         of office as the most popular president in recent history.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">On the other hand, another former president, Jimmy Carter, better understood the awesome responsibilities of his office, but
         was completely overwhelmed by them. He was too keenly aware of his own limitations. Consequently, he agonized over important
         issues. The American people interpreted his agony as incompetence and turned him out of office by a wide majority. By truly
         appreciating the difficulties facing the nation and allowing the public to share in his insecurities, Carter projected a sense
         of powerless despair.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">If Colonel Oliver North had felt one shred of guilt about the crimes in the Iran-Contra Affair to which he admitted involvement,
         he would be in jail today. Instead, he is a free 
         <a id="page12"></a>man, a symbol of patriotism to millions and a speaker who commands huge fees. He expressed no remorse for his criminal actions.
         Oliver North believed so strongly that he was a patriot that he communicated a heroic image to millions of people. A man less
         convinced of his own righteousness would have been severely punished for his crimes and ostracized by the public.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">A Thick Face need not be assertive or aggressive. He may be humble and submissive. Thick Face is the ability to adopt whatever
         manner the situation calls for without regard for what other people think of you.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">There is an ancient Chinese story about a young man named Han Xin who had a reputation as a skilled Kung Fu fighter. One day
         when Han was walking through the streets of his city, he was stopped by two men who had heard of his skill. The pair challenged
         him to a fight to the death. Han tried to decline the challenge, but the men would not let him walk away. They insisted he
         must either fight or crawl like a dog through the leader’s outspread legs. Although to the Chinese this is an unspeakable
         humiliation, Han Xin chose to crawl rather than fight.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">Word of his humiliation and his cowardice spread quickly through the city. He was laughed at openly, yet he never once offered
         any excuse or explanation for his seemingly spineless action. Later in his life, he revealed himself to be one of the most
         formidable and fearless warriors in the history of China. To him, the pair of unschooled ruffians had posed no threat. It
         was simply that they were unworthy adversaries. In his heart he knew himself to be a fearless warrior. He did not care what
         anyone else thought. Han’s Thick Face was a meek and cowardly facade, adopted to save himself the trouble of killing two such
         inconsequential hoodlums.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">In contrast to Han Xin’s inner sense of worth, there is the case of a friend of mine who is currently involved in helping
         <a id="page13"></a>a doctor develop and patent a prototype piece of medical equipment. In the beginning, there was a vague and inconclusive discussion
         about a partnership in exchange for my friend’s technical expertise in building the apparatus. Since then, my friend has worked
         tirelessly, but nothing more has been said about the partnership or any other form of compensation. My friend is reluctant
         to bring it up because he does not have the prototype working properly, and he does not feel worthy of compensation. He has
         not asked for my advice, so I have not given it. I think he would do well to adopt the thick face of a man with a strong sense
         of his own worth. He would get his partnership for precisely the reason he is using as an excuse not to confront the doctor:
         the device is not yet working right. He is still needed.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">When he has it working and feels confident enough to go to the doctor to discuss compensation, who knows what he will get?
         At that point, he will be at a severe disadvantage. The doctor will have already achieved his objective and may have no further
         use for him.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre8">Black Heart—The Spear</h2>
      <p class="toc-front">Black Heart is the ability to take action without regard to how the consequences will affect others. A Black Heart is ruthless,
         but it is not necessarily evil.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">Before the advent of modern medicine, a surgeon operated without being able to anesthetize the patient. He had to be able
         to cut swiftly and decisively without any regard for his patient’s screams and entreaties. In order to be effective, he had
         to be extremely callous and emotionally detached from the pain he caused.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">Conversely, a general who is so full of human compassion that he is reluctant to order soldiers to their death is of no use
         
         <a id="page14"></a>to his country. He will be defeated and his people conquered; whereas a black-hearted general can put the carnage of battle
         out of his mind and fully concentrate on the required result: victory.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">An entrepreneur must be able to make hard decisions regarding unprofitable operations. If he cannot, his company will fail.
         The end result of shortsighted compassion for some employers will be the closure of their entire operation and all of their
         employees out of work.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">The black-hearted person is above shortsighted compassion. He focuses his attention on his goals and ignores the cost.</p>
      <p class="toc-front">A black-hearted person has the courage to fail. Attempting effective action always implies the risk of failure. A surgeon
         who has an accident victim in need of a potentially dangerous operation knows that the safest course is not to operate. Although
         the patient is likely to die, the surgeon risks little censure. If he operates and the patient dies, he knows that he risks
         being blamed for the death.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre8">Two Sides of the Same Coin</h2>
      <p class="toc-front">Thick Face and Black Heart are two sides of the same coin. When one possesses the strength of Thick Face, one can ignore the
         criticism and disapproval of the masses. This same strength is also the source of the Black Heart; it allows one to effectively
         use the spear to cut through the ignorant and preconceived ideas of the masses.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">It is not possible to practice Thick Face without Black Heart, just as it is not possible to practice Black Heart without
         Thick Face. The Thick Face, Black Heart practitioner must exercise his ability to ignore criticism, ridicule, and vilification
         from others, while simultaneously carrying out his 
         <a id="page15"></a>duties as he sees fit. At any given time, he may freely draw upon more power of Thick Face and less power of Black Heart,
         or vice versa, as the situation dictates.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre8">THREE PHASES OF THICK FACE, BLACK HEART</h1>
      <h2 class="calibre8">Phase One: Winning At All Costs</h2>
      <p class="toc-front">Thick Face, Black Heart at its crudest level has no moral overtones. It purely addresses how to get what you want: in other
         words, winning at all costs. Thick Face at this level is total lack of conscience; Black Heart is absolute ruthlessness.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">In its crudest, most superficial form, Thick Face, Black Heart is not about ethics; it is about effective action. A brief
         glance at the newspaper provides an example: Employees of a major airline have been caught falsifying maintenance reports
         and safety checks in order to reduce operating costs. The executives who ordered these falsifications clearly understood that
         they were placing the lives of their passengers, pilots, and crews in great jeopardy—which was totally disproportionate to
         the money they were saving.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">A spear is a useful tool for peacekeeping as well as a weapon of death. Thick Face, Black Heart, like the spear, does not
         in itself contain evil; yet, one can apply Thick Face, Black Heart purely for the pursuit of selfish gains at any costs. Some
         people are intuitively skillful at utilizing Thick Face, Black Heart as a tool to fulfill their selfish motives. For these
         people, no price is too high to pay for victory, so long as it is achieved at someone else’s expense.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">From ancient times to the present, from East to West, there are many instances of people who have gained through 
         <a id="page16"></a>the utilization of Phase One Thick Face, Black Heart. Observe the failure of the American savings and loan institutions and
         the illegal dealings of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. All of the “prestigious” individuals behind the scenes
         of these institutions are masters of Thick Face, Black Heart at its crudest level.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">Their face is impenetrably thick; shielding them from all possible criticism from others and from their own conscience. Their
         heart is so black that when they used their spears on the unsuspecting, trusting public, these innocent depositors were fated
         to slow death from financial bleeding. For these individuals, selfish gain is the aim, and Thick Face, Black Heart is the
         means.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">Phase One Thick Face, Black Heart leads us to winning, yet our victory often has no sweetness. More often than not, life,
         through its mysterious forces, will cause our ill deeds to catch up with us. To conquer others through ruthless means is not
         difficult: all you must do is agree to sell your soul to the devil.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">There are three stages of the phase one level:</p>
      <p class="toc-front">The first stage: thick as a castle wall, black as charcoal. This is the level of the cheap hustler, crook, and con man. Although
         the face is as thick as a castle wall, it is penetrable. Their blackness is apparent to all who see them. They are distasteful
         and repulsive in everyone’s eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">The second stage: thick and hard, black and shimmering. These are the more advanced practitioners. They have strengthened
         their face by hardening it; they have polished their Black Heart to make it more appealing. They are no longer the cheap hustler.
         Their outward appearance is respectable. They are the kind of people you think you can trust, only to discover later that
         you have been taken.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">The third stage: so thick it is formless, so black it is colorless—the 
         <a id="page17"></a>highest level. This is the level of seemingly virtuous men who can ruthlessly pursue their own ends while being extolled by
         their victims for their virtue. Some of our politicians, from the past to the present, have achieved such a state.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre8">Phase Two: Self-Inquiry</h2>
      <p class="vtx"><em class="calibre4">Conquering others requires force.</em></p>
      <p class="vtx"><em class="calibre4">Conquering oneself requires strength.</em></p>
      <p class="vtxs2"><em class="calibre4">—L<small class="calibre6">AO</small> T<small class="calibre6">ZU</small>,</em> T<small class="calibre6">AO</small> T<small class="calibre6">E</small> C<small class="calibre6">HING</small></p>
      <p class="toc-front">Beneath Phase One lie deeper essences of Thick Face, Black Heart., When some people practice Phase One Thick Face, Black Heart,
         they find it to be repellent, even to themselves. Consequently, they begin a process of self-inquiry.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">Self-inquiry is a spiritual process. We cannot honestly or completely address Thick Face, Black Heart without mentioning the
         spiritual side of life, as this aspect colors the realities of all of our business practices and personal conduct. People
         bring who they are to business, and they usually behave in business as they behave everywhere else.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">In the eyes of the Oriental, there are no divisions between business, the art of war, philosophy, and spirituality. The wisdom
         of spirituality is the root of mundane living. While the wisdom is one, the applications are infinite. Conversely, the Western
         world generally segments the knowledge of living into pieces and then files them away in separate compartments. Those who
         practice Phase One of Thick Face, Black Heart without the cultivation of Phase Two can become dangerous people.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">At the stage of self-inquiry, the individual is often 
         <a id="page18"></a>vulnerable because he has rejected the powerful, wicked behaviors of Phase One and is in search of the realm of the unknown.
         His spirit is also demanding greater satisfaction from his conduct. He is in a state of uncertainty, confusion, and sometimes
         pain and anger.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">He is overwhelmed by his own new discovery of a multitude of enemies within himself in the form of his own character defects:
         greed, anger, self-doubt, self-limitation, jealousy, envy, fear, shame, worry, small-mindedness, hatred, delusion, desire,
         selfishness, laziness, hypocrisy, and pretension. He has discovered that his own mind is the root of high and low, honor and
         insult, joy and sorrow, while at the same time his foes are many and his capacity to overcome these obstacles is meager.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">At this stage, even though he may look disheveled and be considered disjointed by others, within himself he is going through
         a powerful transformation.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre8">Phase Three: The Warrior</h2>
      <p class="toc-front">This final phase is the combination of both previous phases. Here you will be able to create a meeting ground for the sublime
         and the ruthless. The following are the qualities of a warrior.
      </p>
      <h3 class="calibre9">D<small class="calibre6">lSPASSION AND</small> D<small class="calibre6">ETACHMENT</small></h3>
      <p class="toc-front">After Phase Two, the practitioner becomes indifferent and courageous. He adopts the warrior’s attitude—dispassion and detachment.
         He sees life as a battle that must be fought. There is no way out. Victory is the only aim.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">He dispassionately does battle with the wicked outer elements while courageously facing his inner enemies. He is 
         <a id="page19"></a>then able to detach from them, so that their presence does not thwart him. It is this power of detachment and dispassion that
         enables the warrior to face life’s challenges with calm and grace.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">The thirteenth-century Hindu philosopher Shankaracharya mentioned that even the greatest warrior, when standing in the midst
         of the battlefield, sweats with fear. However, while his body is fearful and his mind is fearful, his spirit is fearless.
         He is able to detach himself from the fear of the body and the mind, clinging instead to the fearlessness of his spirit.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">Recently, I watched an old movie, a story about the courage and love of the early American pioneer settlers. It was evident
         that they understood the sublime state of calm detachment. They were indifferent to suffering, taking action in spite of their
         fear, enduring the loneliness, quietly accepting and overcoming the adversity while never losing sight of their objectives.
         Witnessing their warrior-like courage and self-determination moved me many times to tears during the film.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">It is not that you are not affected by the challenges and become inert in this state of detachment. Rather, you are not controlled
         by your emotions, so you may press on with greater courage and renewed energy.
      </p>
      <h3 class="calibre9">F<small class="calibre6">IT FOR</small> G<small class="calibre6">REATNESS</small></h3>
      <p class="toc-front">I have seen many people grow old, but not graciously. Their eyes reflect pain and disillusionment. They have been beaten by
         life; they have so many broken dreams. The hope and expectations of youth have vanished—only death awaits.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">The mistake they made was in not preparing themselves for the harsh lessons their Creator set for them on life’s path—necessary
         lessons to strengthen their spirit and make them fit for greatness. Unlike the warrior who accepts harsh 
         <a id="page20"></a>discipline as a privilege and honor, these people are like pieces of grain caught in the millstone, ground down by the wheel
         of life, in agony and in pain.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">As most do, I used to pray for good times and good fortune. The prayer “Let thy will be done” used to scare me to death. In
         reality, though, this world in which we live is fragile and ever-changing, and our existence and survival are delicately connected
         to the invisible thread of God’s grace. Gain and loss are the constant human condition.

      <p class="toc-front">As I watched the fire in the Oakland and Berkeley hills in the San Francisco Bay Area that burned seven hundred luxury homes,
         it confirmed again that it does not matter how much we wish to ignore the possibility of any negative and unpleasant aspects
         of our lives, our Creator writes His own script for life. Now when I pray, I pray for the unshakable inner strength and the
         strength of the warrior to accept these harsh lessons and learn from them, not to be destroyed by them.

      <p class="toc-front">In this book, we will be dealing mostly with Phase Three. We will learn how to live in this world and not be a victim of it;
         nor will we impose pain and loss unjustly on those who do not deserve it. Our objective in practicing Thick Face, Black Heart
         is to be able to defend ourselves against others’ aggression.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">In this way we become warriors, but not in the traditional Western sense of “killing machines.” The outer ability of the warrior
         to effectively execute his objective is guided by inner wisdom, which is cultivated through the acceptance of life’s challenges
         and the quest for spiritual balance.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">The sixteenth-century Japanese sword master Miyomoto Musashi said, “The warrior is one who uses the pen and 
         <a id="page21"></a>sword with equal skill.” The message here is that to be a truly great warrior, you must be skilled with more than your weapon.
         The great soldier is a balanced being, who through his understanding of life is able to master the virtue of his weapons.
         How the samurai handles his sword is metaphorically equivalent to how we handle our daily tasks, especially the task of surviving.
         Musashi also said, “The way of warrior skill is the way of nature. When you are in line with the power of nature, knowing
         the rhythm of all situations, you will be able to cut and strike the enemy naturally.”
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">As you practice Phase Three Thick Face, Black Heart, gradually you will see no division or conflict between the spiritual
         world and the mundane world. Your spiritual strength will become an essential tool to conquer the day-to-day realities. As
         we incorporate the sublime spiritual insights into the ruthless business world, we will gain the best of both worlds.

      <p class="toc-front">
         <a id="page22"></a>In every action there are two aspects—the inner and the outer. The inner is the force that motivates one’s actions. It is
         unseen by anyone. The outer is the expression of the inner state. It is visible to all.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">Contrary to common understanding, a good man’s actions are not always gentle. They may be ruthless, cold, and dispassionate.
         A friend of mind once made a very profound statement when he said, “When people act overly nice, I always wonder about their
         motives.”
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">There was once a master who had charge over many disciples. All entertained great intentions to gain enlightenment, yet each
         waged battle with his uncontrolled desires. The master would appear to ignore their misbehavior and allow them to indulge
         in their minor mischief, then, suddenly, like a thunderbolt, he would strike. He punished the offenders severely, sometimes
         even with a whip across the body, so the disciple would never forget the lesson. A witness may have believed this action by
         the master to be violent and cruel. Yet the disciples only experienced the love of the master and were grateful for the master’s
         teaching.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">In the Christian Holy Bible, St. Mark tells the story of the money changers, in which Jesus Christ goes into the temple in
         Jerusalem and angrily overturns all their tables and chairs, saying that God’s temple was for prayer, not for use as “a den
         of thieves.” Even though Jesus’ outward expression was one of anger, this did not affect his peaceful inner state.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">Conversely, some people wear permanent, plastic smiles on their face in their eagerness to be considered by others as nice
         people. It is very obvious to most that the smile is merely skin deep, yet these people spend all of their constructive energies
         putting up this sweet facade, which leaves them empty and powerless within.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">A good man’s outward appearance and actions sometimes may appear to be cruel and violent and his expression 
         <a id="page23"></a>egotistical, yet he possesses a pure heart within. On the other hand, a false prophet may express an apparent high degree
         of outward humility and gentleness, but inwardly his sole objective is self-gain. A false prophet, in order to thrive, is
         dependent on the approval of the public, whereas a good man lives in harmony with himself—he neither seeks nor needs external
         approval.
      </p>
      <p class="toc-front">The natural way of Thick Face, Black Heart is beyond human manipulation, beyond the petty standards of human judgment. When
         one acts in harmony with the Universal Will, one’s actions are aligned with the good of all and the benefit of all. You are
         neither self-righteous nor too eager to please; nor are you seeking approval. In action, you are swift, competent, and dispassionate.
         In yielding, you are unabashed and have no concern for others’ judgments. In conquering, you are effective and can be ruthless.
         In action and nonaction, you are changeless. You are a true Thick Face, Black Heart practitioner.
